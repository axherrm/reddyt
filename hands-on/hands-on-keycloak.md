# Hands On Keycloak

Picture this: you’ve built the Mona Lisa of web apps. It’s sleek, responsive, and your mom already told all her friends about it. 
But there’s a problem—who’s sneaking in? The neighbor’s cat? Your ex? The bots plotting to sell your user data?

Enter Keycloak, the bouncer your web app deserves. 
Keycloak doesn’t just stand at the door checking IDs—it’s the ultimate gatekeeper, ready to keep out the riffraff while handing VIP badges to your legitimate users. 
With just a few configurations, it turns your app into a fortress, complete with identity management, single sign-on (SSO), and all the cool acronyms you can dream of.

In this guide, we’ll show you how to integrate Keycloak into your app, step by step, without needing a master’s degree in security wizardry. 
Think of it as the IKEA of authentication setups—minimal tools, clear-ish instructions, and the occasional head-scratch. 
By the end, your app will have more swagger than a nightclub with a velvet rope. Let’s dive in!

## Setup Simple Web App
Alright, it’s time to roll up our sleeves and get down to business. Before Keycloak can work its magic, we need a web app that’s ready to welcome it with open arms (and a solid codebase). Think of this as setting up the stage for Keycloak to come in and steal the show.  

### Step 1: Gather Your Ingredients  

We’re keeping it simple here—a lightweight Flask app with just enough sauce to showcase Keycloak’s power. First, let’s get those dependencies in line:  

`requirements.txt`:  
```text
Flask==3.1.0
Jinja2==3.1.4
Authlib==1.3.2
python-keycloak==5.1.1
```
Why these? Flask is our go-to for quick and clean web apps, Jinja2 handles the templating, and Authlib plus python-keycloak will help us tango with Keycloak like pros.
### Step 2: Hello, Flask!

Next, whip up a simple `app.py` to get the app running:
```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.get("/")
def display_index():
    return "Hello World!"
```
This is your web app equivalent of “Hello, it’s me.” Nothing fancy, but hey, every masterpiece starts with a blank canvas.

### Step 3: Fire It Up
Now it’s time to see our baby take its first steps. Follow these commands:
```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m flask run
```
If everything goes smoothly, you’ll see your app live at http://127.0.0.1:5000. 
Open it up in your browser, and there it is: a humble “Hello World!” waiting to grow into something much cooler.

### What’s Next?
Congrats, you’ve built the perfect playground for Keycloak to show off its skills. 
In the next section, we’ll bring in the bouncer, set up the ID checks, and make sure no shady characters sneak past the door. 
Buckle up—it’s about to get fun!
